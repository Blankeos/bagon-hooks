A collection of zero-dependency hooks for SolidJS forked directly from Mantine Hooks.

## Quick start

Install it:

```bash
npm i bagon-hooks
# or
yarn add bagon-hooks
# or
pnpm add bagon-hooks
# or
bun add bagon-hooks
```

Use it:

```tsx
import { useHotkeys } from 'bagon-hooks';
```

We want to achieve as 1:1 as possible with Mantine's original hooks. So you can always refer to their [original docs](https://v3.mantine.dev/hooks/use-hotkeys/). There are a few improvements and renaming because SolidJS has its own conventions. But just take note:

1. We removed Solid's convention of `use` vs `create` as it's too confusing for familiarity with Mantine. So every hook in Bagon is prefixed with `use`.
2. The only renaming we did was `state` -> `signal`.
3. Refer to [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-click-outside/)'s original docs for deeper examples and usecases.
4. Refer to [Bagon Hooks](https://bagon-hooks.pages.dev/)'s docs for actual SolidJS examples.

## Features
